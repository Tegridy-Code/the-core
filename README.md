## Repo for the draft model for the AGI core.

***

### Based on OpenAI GPT2 Transformer Architecture

***

#### Let's call it Asyncronous NLP GAN for now...

The Core code repo located here:

https://github.com/asigalov61/Torah-GPT2

Should be used together with The Core Antagonist model:

Its too big so I am providing Google Drive link (~3GB tar)

The Core Antagonist code repo located here:
https://github.com/asigalov61/gpt-2-simple

and maybe more up-to-date version can be found here:

Can be scaled with great ease. Recommended scaled network shape, gradient shape, and weights distribution: orb network (think precisely orb spider web).

Enjoy :)
